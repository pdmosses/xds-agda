# PCF (Plotkin 1977)

> PCF is a call-by-name simply-typed λ-calculus equipped with one or two base
> types (usually natural numbers and Booleans) and a fixed point combinator.
> In essence, PCF is the simplest lazy, purely functional programming language.

## Variants of PCF

PCF and its denotational semantics were orginally defined by Dana Scott in 1969
([Scott 1993]) including combinators (`S`, `K`) instead of λ-abstraction.
Gordon Plotkin subsequently defined a denotational semantics for PCF including 
λ-abstraction ([Plotkin 1977]).

Many authors have defined denotational semantics for PCF ([PLS Lab]). Recently,
Tom de Jong has given a definition in Agda ([DomainTheory.ScottModelOfPCF])
based on the [DomainTheory] modules from the [TypeTopology] library. The syntax
follows ([Scott 1993]) by including combinators instead of λ-abstraction.

De Jong's semantics of PCF was extended to PCF with variables and λ-abstraction
by Brendan Hart in a final year project supervised by Martín Escardó and
De Jong ([Hart 2020]).[^1] Hart used De Bruin indices for variables.

[^1]: Both De Jong and Hart deviate slightly from Scott's original semantics
    of the predecessor function by defining it to return zero when applied to
    zero, instead of being undefined.

The definitions of the denotations of PCF terms given by De Jong and Hart
illustrate the notational overhead that arises in Agda when using the
[DomainTheory] modules, compared to the definitions given by Scott and Plotkin.
