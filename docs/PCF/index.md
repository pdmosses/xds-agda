# PCF

**[PCF/PCF.All.html](PCF.All.md)** is the root of a section of this website showing
an Agda formalization of the denotational semantics of the PCF language.

**[PCF/html/PCF.All.html](html/PCF.All.html)** is the root of the orginal HTML pages
generated by Agda from (potentially literate) source code in the [GitHub repository].

**[PCF.pdf]** is a highlighted PDF listing of all the Agda modules.

## About PCF

> PCF is a call-by-name simply-typed λ-calculus equipped with one or two base
> types (usually natural numbers and Booleans) and a fixed point combinator.
> In essence, PCF is the simplest lazy, purely functional programming language.
> ([PLS Lab])

PCF and its denotational semantics were orginally defined by Dana Scott in 1969
([Scott 1993]) including combinators (`S`, `K`) instead of λ-abstraction.
Gordon Plotkin subsequently defined a denotational semantics for PCF including 
λ-abstraction ([Plotkin 1977]).

A direct transcription of Plotkin's definition to Agda is available in this
repo at [PCF.All] (see also the [generated PDF][Generated PDF of PCF]).
The code imports various modules from the [standard Agda library v2.1], and
typechecks with Agda v2.6.4.3 using the (blatantly unsafe) workarounds and
postulates in the [Domains][PCF Domains] module.

Many authors have defined denotational semantics for PCF ([PLS Lab]). Recently,
Tom de Jong has given a definition in Agda ([DomainTheory.ScottModelOfPCF])
based on the [DomainTheory] modules from the [TypeTopology] library. The syntax
follows ([Scott 1993]) by including combinators instead of λ-abstraction.

De Jong's semantics of PCF was extended to PCF with variables and λ-abstraction
by Brendan Hart in a final year project supervised by Martín Escardó and
De Jong ([Hart 2020]).[^1] Hart used De Bruin indices for variables.

[^1]: Both De Jong and Hart deviate slightly from Scott's original semantics
    of the predecessor function by defining it to return zero when applied to
    zero, instead of being undefined.

The definitions of the denotations of PCF terms given by De Jong and Hart
illustrate the notational overhead that arises in Agda when using the
[DomainTheory] modules, compared to the definitions given by Scott and Plotkin.
