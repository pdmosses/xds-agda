# A Sublanguage of Scheme

> Scm is a particularly basic sublanguage of the core Scheme expressions whose denotational semantics
is defined in the [Scheme reports].

A denotational semantics for Scm is defined in the following paper:

> Peter D. Mosses. 2025. A Compositional Semantics for `eval` in Scheme.
> In *Proceedings of the Workshop Dedicated to Olivier Danvy*
> *on the Occasion of His 64th Birthday (OLIVIERFEST ’25),*
> *October 12–18, 2025, Singapore, Singapore.*
> ACM, New York, NY, USA, 10 pages. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3759427.3760369)

The [Agda code] of a lightweight formalization of the denotational semantics of Scm is available on GitHub.
